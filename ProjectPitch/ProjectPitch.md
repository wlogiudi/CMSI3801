# Project Overview:

The aim of this project is to develop a chatbot that generates random stories based on three keywords provided by the user. The chatbot will allow users to input three keywords, and it will respond by generating and presenting a story associated with those keywords. The stories will be stored in the system, mapped to specific sets of keywords, offering a diverse range of narratives for various inputs.

# Feature Specification:

- **User Input**: Users can enter three keywords as input.
- **Story Generation**: The chatbot generates a story based on the provided keywords.
- **Keyword-Story Mapping**: The system contains a database or mapping of stories corresponding to specific sets of keywords.
- **Random Story Selection**: If multiple stories match the provided keywords, the chatbot randomly selects one to present.
- **Error Handling**: If no story matches the given keywords, the chatbot displays an appropriate error message.
- **Scalability**: Ability to expand the database of stories and keywords easily for a broader selection of narratives.
- **User Interface**: A simple and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

# Technical Specification:

- **Programming Language**: Python for backend logic and story generation.
- **Data Storage**: Stories mapped to keywords stored in a dictionary or database for easy retrieval.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilize NLP libraries for handling user input and understanding context for better story selection.
- **Randomization**: Use Python's random library for selecting stories when multiple matches are found.
- **Interface**: Can be implemented as a console application or integrated into a chatbot framework using appropriate libraries.
